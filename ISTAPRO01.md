**Intro**  
Ever since I was a young boy, I've been a builder and a tinkerer. From sand castles and tree houses to Lego sets and models. When I was eight years old, my grandfather gave my family his old IMB computer, and at that moment became a computer nerd. Almost every aspect of computer technology fascinates me; everything from hardware construction to web design and game development. I'd like to explore every avenue of the field that I can.
Not only do I enjoy making new creations, I also spend a considerable amount of time and energy streamlining existing designs and processes every time I find myself in a new job or workspace. I am searching for my role in the IT industry now, and with the help of some friends, mentors, and the MSSA I will find the perfect fit for myself. My first step towards my goal will be to research a few selections from various types of software.

**Testing System**  
When considering my project ideas, I first thought about the exam I had to take in order to get into the MSSA program to start with. The MTA: Software Development Fundamentals was a computer based exam presenting questions one at a time to the user, with multiple choice answers. The interface was clean and clearly understandable, but it was just that. A simple, no frills test. Another similar exam I have taken in the past was the NREMT(National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians) Advanced EMT Exam. Again, this was a computer based exam, presenting multiple choice questions to the user, but this exam had another mechanic. It was adaptive, in that the more correct answers the user entered, the harder the subsequent questions became. If the user continued this trend, the exam could be completed after answering fewer questions than if the user had entered incorrect answers. I liked this style of exam, and I believe de-constructing these mechanics and rebuilding a similar exam system would expose me to a multitude of advanced and dynamic coding systems I haven't yet had the opportunity to see.

**Database GUI**  
During my time in class, and even during this preliminary research, it has become apparent to me that databases are everywhere. I was directed to look into a software called Toad; a database management toolset used in the IT industry to manage both relational and non-relational databases using SQL. The software works in conjunction with existing systems like SSMS, and automates a lot of processes for ease of use. But I didn't have to look even that far to find an example of database management. The common personal bank app on a smartphone is a good example of front end database management on a small scale that feeds into a larger one. I've decided, therefore, that I will focus in on database study. By becoming intimately familiar with building and manipulating databases, I will be putting myself in a good place to move forward with almost any career in the field.

**Strategy Game**  
Finally, I get to the good part. As a gamer, the ability to deconstruct and rebuild a game is a dream. Even if I don't end up in the game development industry, just having the tools and knowledge I would need to play around with side projects would be very fulfilling. I see game development as kind of a culmination of everything above and really pushing the expertise of a programmer. However, as a new recruit into the field, I will be looking at very simple games like chess and checkers to get my foot in the door. With basic rules and minimal GUI, I feel like these are the kinds of games I can accomplish at this point.

**Conclusion**  
After all this research and deep contemplation on how to proceed into the programming world, I've come to the conclusion that there is much to learn if I want to become a skilled coder. Nevertheless, I am excited to get into it, excited to build and tinker to my heart's content. This term project may well be the greatest boon to my developing skill base during my time under the tutelage of the MSSA. I can not wait to see how it all plays out.
