**Intro**  
You guys know me. I'm interested in learning and mastering new things. I've enjoyed the class because it's new ideas and concepts almost every day with solid practice that doesn't get redundant. One branch of programming I don't expect to touch on in the class is building games, so I'm continuing to peruse building a checkers game. Building this game won't help me to get on the team for the next Call of Duty release, but it will expose me to a lot of features related to GUI and event oriented code.

**Summary**  
As you know, I will be building a basic checkers game. The game will be either two player, or player vs computer. The latter aspect will be a serious challenge to figure out for me. As with any checkers game, each player will take a turn making valid moves until one player runs out of pieces. The game will have a simple GUI; I'm not interested in building a AAA app store game, I'm just concerned with learning about the code.

**Information Architecture**  
The game will hold most of it's data in RAM during gameplay. The only data that I will need to store in a permanent database will be the statistics. Player names, ID's, wins, losses, and games played will be sent to the database at the end of each game. Unfortunately this means I will not get a lot of practice with data management with this project.

**Conclusion**  
I'm still not entirely sure which approach I'm going to use to build this program. I've gotten some practice with Windows Forms by following online tutorials, but I know that WF is an outdates framework. Another approach could be using entirely HTML and CSS to build the game, but I'd much rather use C#. I don't know much about ASP.Net Core yet, but it would be my preferred choice of framework.
